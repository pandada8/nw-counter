For example:\n\t *\n\t *                                            <Paper>\n\t *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n\t *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n\t *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n\t *                                            </Paper>\n\t *\n\t *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n\t *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n\t *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n\t *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n\t *\n\t *  <p>\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n\t *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n\t *  </p>\n\t *\n\t *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n\t *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n\t *\n\t *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n\t *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar BeforeAfterWrapper = React.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\t\n\t  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\t\n\t  contextTypes: {\n\t    muiTheme: React.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    beforeStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t    afterStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t    beforeElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    afterElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    elementType: React.PropTypes.string\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n\t    return {\n\t      beforeElementType: 'div',\n\t      afterElementType: 'div',\n\t      elementType: 'div'\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  //for passing default theme context to children\n\t  childContextTypes: {\n\t    muiTheme: React.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n\t    return {\n\t      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n\t    return {\n\t      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme ?
